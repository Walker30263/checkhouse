    <h2>Age Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      By creating an account on our website, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old. 
      If you are not, you must have an adult above the age of 18 create an account on behalf 
      of you and agree to these Terms of Service. If we discover that you were under the age of 13
      when creating your account, we have the right to delete your account without notice.
    </p>
    <h2>No NSFW content</h2>
    <p>
      Adult content is strictly prohibited. 
      We have the right to immediately ban your account if we find that you are distributing 18+ content
      through our website using profile pictures, bios, etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Respect other users</h2>
    <p>
      You may not use our website to promote any form of bigotry, such as racism, sexism, 
      homophobia, transphobia, etc. We have the right to warn you, edit your account info, or ban your account
      if we find offensive content on your profile. 
      <br>
      <br>
      You may not use our website to bully other users. This includes
      making repetitive negative comments about other users, or creating and using alternate accounts 
      to gain an unfair advantage in games available on our website.

      <br>
      Do not engage in hacking: activities intended to cause damage or let you gain unauthorized access to
      another user's account or our server. This includes impersonating staff, distributing malware, and other hacking
